In addition to Rich Snippets for reviews, people, video and events, this week we unveiled a new Rich Snippets format for recipes. This means that when your search results include sites with recipe content, you might see quick facts pertaining to the recipe in your search results, like preparation or cooking times, right on the search results page. If you have a site with recipes and want to be sure Rich Snippets show up in search results for your page, check out our documentation on how to mark up recipe information as well as our general help articles on Rich Snippets. Bon app\u00e9tit!Example search: [baked ziti]Enhancements to real-time searchThis week, we launched a new feature in real-time search that gives you the ability to search and replay the public archive of tweets on Twitter. While real-time search usually focuses on what's happening now, our new feature is helpful for viewing the history of what happened in the past and how people reacted to a particular topic on Twitter. You can zoom into any point in time \u2014 from a year, to a month, to a half-hour \u2014 and \"replay\" tweets from as far back as February 11, 2010 (and soon, as far back as the very first tweet on March 21, 2006). To try this feature out, click \u201cShow options\u201d on the search results page, and then select \u201cUpdates.\u201d You'll notice a new chart at the top of the page, where you'll be able to adjust the time range of the tweets you'd like to see. We hope you enjoy your trip down the 140-character memory lane.Example search: [museum of modern art]Oftentimes, there's great new content published to the web that everyone is talking about at one particular time. So, to help you find those sites, we also recently launched the top links for a set of update results, showcasing some of the top URLs that Twitter users are talking about based on a particular query. To view these links, click \u201cShow options\u201d on the search results page, and then select \u201cUpdates.\u201d You'll see a list of links on the right-hand side based on your query.Example search: [ipad]Google Suggest and spell correction enhancementsWe've recently made some enhancements that make it easier and faster for you to get the most relevant answer using Google search. We've begun to tailor Suggest to U.S. metro areas, so you'll find that the suggested queries are more locally relevant than they used to be. Try searching for [parks in], and you'll most likely see suggested search queries for parks that really are in your neck of the woods.In addition, we've improved our spelling correction feature. Sometimes, when you search for something that we're highly confident you've misspelled, we'll take you directly to the search results page for the correct spelling without asking \"Did you mean...?\" This week, we made this feature available in 31 languages across over 180 domains across the globe. We've also made some changes to how this feature deals with misspelled names. We realized that often when you search for a person's name, you include descriptive words (say, the person's profession or company) that can provide valuable context. We use these extra descriptors to offer you better suggestions, so you should soon find this feature for names more useful.Example search: [jordin farmer lakers]Stay tuned for more updates next week.Posted by Gabriel Stricker, Director, Global Communications &amp; Public Affairs \n \n"

Look for the label \"Google Apps highlights\" and subscribe to the series. - Ed.Today\u2019s update includes a big batch of new functionality in Google Docs and several new capabilities in Gmail.  So the next time you\u2019re in Google Apps, give these new features a spin.Google Docs reloadedOn Monday we released a preview of the new Google Docs, which brings added features, higher fidelity for imported documents, more speed and faster collaboration to our browser-based productivity tools. Documents sport features that weren\u2019t feasible with older browser technology, like a new ruler for margins and tab stops, better bullets and numbered lists, easier image placement and character-by-character real-time collaboration in the browser.  Spreadsheets now have a formula editing bar, drag-and-drop columns and cell auto-fill. They support up to 50 simultaneous collaborators, and are much faster and more responsive overall.  We added Google drawings to the mix as well, so you can work with others to create flow-charts, schematics and other kinds of diagrams together in real-time.Calendar integration in GmailTo make it easier to schedule time with people without leaving your inbox, now you can see people\u2019s availability (if you have permission) and send event invitations from Gmail.  As you\u2019re composing a message, click the \u201cInsert: Invitation\u201d link to choose a time that works for the recipients on your email and add details about your event.  When you\u2019re done, the email message will display details about your event.Drag-and-drop attachments in GmailYesterday we introduced a simpler way to add attachments in Gmail: just drag files onto Gmail from your desktop or from a folder as you compose a message. You can drag multiple files at once, and on a Mac, you can even drag files from folders in the Dock. This feature works in Chrome or Firefox 3.6+ right now, and other browsers may support this feature in the future.Nested Labels and Message Sneak Peek in Gmail LabsLast week we launched two new Labs features in Gmail.  Nested Labels lets you create hierarchies of labels, giving you more flexibility how you organize your saved email.  Message Sneak Peek lets you preview messages without having to open them.  Just right-click a message in your inbox to sneak a quick peek.Gmail on the Apple iPadWe released a new version of the Gmail web interface specially designed for the larger screen of the iPad.  Gmail on the iPad has a convenient two-pane display with a list of your conversations on the left, and full messages on the right.Who\u2019s gone Google?More and more colleges and universities are moving to the cloud with Google Apps.  This week we\u2019re pleased to welcome the University of Wisconsin at La Crosse, UNLV, Meredith College and Belmont Abbey College. The State Library of Kansas, the Mind Research Network and more than 50,000 other businesses and organizations have also gone Google in the last few weeks.I hope you're making the most of these new features, whether you're using Google Apps with friends, family, coworkers or classmates.

            "desc": "We spend a lot of time thinking about search results, but we also spend a lot of time thinking about search queries. Today we\u2019re announcing three enhancements to help you input your searches more quickly and easily: more localized Google Suggest, improved spell correction for names and auto-correction for 31 languages.Feel at home with Google SuggestLast year we launched localized Google Suggest by country, offering relevant popular search queries tailored for different regions. However, just as people in the U.K. often look for different things than people in U.S., we\u2019ve found that people in Seattle tend to look for different things than people in Dallas. So last week, we rolled out a version of Google Suggest that is tailored to specific metro areas in the U.S. You may notice that the list of queries beneath the search box will seem more locally relevant than it used to:In San Francisco [bart] is probably not Bart Simpson; it\u2019s probably Bay Area Rapid Transit:In Chicago it\u2019s easy to find out about your local NBA team:Spelling enhancements for namesWhile Suggest can help you find good queries, sometimes you can get stuck because of misspellings. That\u2019s why for years we\u2019ve offered corrected spellings for mistyped searches (with the \u201cDid you mean\u201d link). We\u2019ve steadily improved this spelling technology over time, but recently we made some big strides in correcting misspelled names.People often search for people\u2019s names \u2014 and not just celebrities and old friends. They look for doctors, horse trainers, hang-gliding instructors... the searches are just as diverse as the personalities in your hometown. We\u2019ve noticed that people sometimes struggle to correctly spell names, and it\u2019s not surprising. Names can be complicated and often there are multiple common spellings.Our new technology is based on the concept that people often know something else about the person besides the approximate spelling of his name. People often include other terms such as \"composer\" or \"lawyer sparta wisconsin\" in their search query, which provides valuable context to help us narrow the range of possibilities for the spelling correction. We use these additional descriptive words to offer you better suggestions. Some examples: [matthew devin oracle], [yuri lehner stanford], [simon tung machine learning]. With these improvements you\u2019ll start seeing more useful spell corrections for names.For now this enhancement is available in our English spelling system in the U.S. We'll be rolling out the change to other parts of the world and other languages in the coming months.Spelling auto-correction in 31 languagesAnother improvement we made recently to the spelling system is auto-correction. If you search for [aiprt], rather than showing you a link on your results page that says \u201cDid you mean: airport\u201d we\u2019ll take you straight to the results for the corrected search. We auto-correct when we\u2019re highly confident in our correction in order to get you the information you\u2019re looking for that much faster. In the past week we\u2019ve expanded auto-correction to 31 languages across over 180 domains, with more to come.Did you make a typo while looking for [chocolate strawberries and cream] in Italian?  The right word is so close you can taste it:While saving you that unnecessary click, we make search that much faster.Posted by Pandu Nayak, Member of Technical Staff\n \n"

You know, there's no newspaper editor done as much for me in the last two years, because my face is smiling on these posters, and I'm very grateful to you and Lord Ashcroft for funding that\u201d, generating queries for Gordon Brown poster and Lord Ashcroft.

Nick Clegg\u2019s repeated railing against renewing the Trident missile and David Cameron\u2019s repeated railing against the jobs tax, a one percent increase in National Insurance contributions, were the other issues generating queries.  Overwhelming these debate-related queries was the eruption of Iceland\u2019s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano and the closure of British air space.During the three weeks, follow the run-up to the May 6 British general election by watching debate highlights on YouTube and searching web trends using Google Insights for Search.Posted by Jeffrey D.

As the filing deadline has approached over the last few days and weeks, we\u2019ve seen a flurry of search interest about taxes and tax related topics.  Compared to search volume from the final week of the 2009 tax season, we\u2019ve seen significant increases in searches for terms like [file taxes] and [tax filing extension].  As of late last week, searches for [file taxes] had increased by 16% from last year. This spike in search interest leading up to April 15 prolongs a pattern of search trends that we\u2019ve seen for the last several years; from 2006 to 2009, searches for [file taxes] rose an average of more than 51% between April 8 and April 15.Perhaps less expected than this final peak is the sizable spike in search volume that we see several months before April 15, around the time that W-2 forms become available. This occurs in early February and, as you can see below, there\u2019s a noticeable increase in searches such as [get W2 form] that are related to the beginning of the tax-filing.In general, tax season search trends look pretty similar each year, but if we dive deeper, there are lots of mini-trends to explore, often triggered by unforeseen and/or unique world events.  For example, we saw a flurry of search interest following the passage of the healthcare reform bill in March. The sharp increase in searches for terms like [taxes healthcare] and [healthcare tax increase] likely reflected curiosity about the implications of the new law on tax filings.We saw a similar trend following the tragic earthquake in Haiti.  The outpouring of support for victims in Haiti generated increased interest in the details of charitable donations as they related to taxes; searches queries like [haiti donation tax] were noticeably high in January.Unfortunately, the implications of heightened unemployment levels were also top of mind this year, and we saw an interest in the effects of joblessness on tax payments and tax filing. Queries like [unemployed taxes] and [unemployment tax refund] were noticeably elevated compared to 2009 search volume, in particular around the season\u2019s first spike.Hopefully, we\u2019ve shed some light on what your fellow taxpayers were interested in over the course of tax season and, via search trends, provided a sense of the different types of events that might affect taxes and tax filing.

To try it out, click \u201cShow options\u201d on the search results page, then select \u201cUpdates.\u201d The first page will show you the familiar latest and greatest short-form updates from a comprehensive set of sources, but now there\u2019s a new chart at the top. In that chart, you can select the year, month or day, or click any point to view the tweets from that specific time period. Here we\u2019ve searched for [golden gate park] and browsed to see March, 2010:The chart shows the relative volume of activity on Twitter about the topic. As you can see, there are daily spikes in the afternoon (when parks are the most fun) and an unusually high spike on March 27. Clicking on the 27th, you\u2019ll discover it was a sunny Saturday, which may explain the increased traffic on Twitter. People were tweeting about disc golf and tennis, biking, riding a party bus, craving chips and salsa...the kind of local, time-specific information that up until now would be almost impossible to find online.By replaying tweets, you can explore any topic that people have discussed on Twitter. Want to know how the news broke about health care legislation in Congress, what people were saying about Justice Paul Stevens\u2019 retirement or what people were tweeting during your own marathon run? These are the kinds of things you can explore with the new updates mode.The replay feature is rolling out now and will be available globally in English within the next couple days (if you want to try it now, try out this special link). For our initial release, you can explore tweets going back to February 11, 2010, and soon you\u2019ll be able to go back as far as the very first tweet on March 21, 2006.All of us are just beginning to understand the many ways real-time information and short-form web content will be useful in the future, and we think being able to make use of historical information is an important part of that. As for me, after some hard work on real-time search, it\u2019s time for a virtual vacation to relive one of my favorite moments of the Winter Games.Posted by Dylan Casey, Product Manager for Real-Time Search\n \n"

To do so, you had to copy and paste the link from one browser window to another \u2014 there weren't buttons that made it easy to post to Google Buzz without leaving the site you're on. Savvy sites like Mashable and TechCrunch quickly got creative and implemented their own Buzz buttons, using Google Reader as the backend. But not every site owner should have to hack together their own version of these buttons (and not everyone who uses Buzz also uses Reader), so this morning we're making copy-and-paste Buzz buttons available for anyone to use.Starting today, you'll see these buttons around the web on participating sites including: The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, Glamour, YouTube, Blogger, MySpace, GigaOM, PBS Parents, PBS NewsHour, The Next Web, TweetDeck, SocialWok, Disqus, Vinehub, and Buzzzy. Mashable and TechCrunch have updated their sites to use these new buttons too. A number of sharing platforms, including ShareThis (pictured below), Meebo, Shareholic, AddThis and AddtoAny have also incorporated the Google Buzz button into their sharing functionality, so you'll see Buzz listed as a choice when you go to share something on many other sites around the web as well.If you want to add Google Buzz buttons to your site, just go to buzz.google.com/stuff, configure your buttons with a couple clicks and copy a few lines of JavaScript. Paste this code where you'd like the Buzz buttons to appear and you're all set.And if you'd like to promote your own Google Buzz account, we have a button for you, which allows people to follow you on Buzz right from your blog or website. Here's an example using the Google Buzz team's own Buzz account (clicking it will take you to the Buzz team's profile page and from there you can easily follow our team's posts):Follow on BuzzYou can grab that button code from buzz.google.com/stuff as well.Posted by Mussie Shore, Product Manager\n \n"

            "desc": "This is the third post in our series on the future of display advertising. Today, Director of Product Management, Ari Paparo, looks at how better data will help marketers plan and measure their display campaigns in the future - Ed.Basketball teams in the 1980s looked at fairly simple statistics \u2014 points, rebounds, assists and shooting percentages \u2014 to measure team and player performance.  However, in recent years, there\u2019s been a data renaissance \u2014 a recognition of the need to develop more insightful measures, and a resurgence in appreciation for the value of data in sports.  Now, professional basketball teams measure all sorts of on-court happenings, as well as more ethereal things like team chemistry and player psychology.  As advertisers and agencies try to plan and measure their display ad campaigns, they\u2019re much like basketball teams stuck in the 80's. Today, planning display advertising campaigns is largely based on relationships and habits, and often-primitive measures of website traffic. If asked to quantify the impact of their display ad campaigns, many advertisers could show you the number of clicks on their ads, and then shrug.The Internet has long held out the promise of being a truly accountable, measurable medium for marketers.  In search advertising, a decade of investment in analytics and measurement tools has helped to realize that promise. But the same tools for display advertising have lagged.In the previous post in this series, Neal Mohan wrote about the creative possibilities that new display advertising technology is enabling.  But how do marketers work out where to buy these ads, and quantify their impact?  Let\u2019s look at what\u2019s becoming possible as we start to use newer technologies, improved statistical models and aggregated data to improve the planning and measurement of display advertising. Imagine an ad agency tasked with planning and measuring a campaign for a new male cologne (specially endorsed by a famous DJ).  The ideal target audience is males aged 18-35 who are interested in dance music, well-groomed and who think they\u2019re hip.Today, it\u2019s possible (using tools like DoubleClick Ad Planner) to find popular U.S. sites that are read by males aged 18-35 who are interested in dance music or who have previously visited the DJ\u2019s website.  Of course, there's no way to tell which sites\u2019 readers are well-groomed or if they\u2019re hip, but media planners can add in terms like \"clubs,\" \"nightlife\", \u201csample sale\u201d and \"fashion\" into Ad Planner\u2019s search term correlator to find sites whose users are more likely to search for those terms, as measured across large quantities of data.Looking forward, what if the agency could seamlessly click a checkbox to pull in site performance data from that same client\u2019s last ad campaign? The planner could rank the sites in the media plan that produced the best results for the last campaign.  And what if the agency could click another checkbox to select recommended high-performing sites in the Google Content Network that offer above the fold placements and that fall within the client\u2019s budget and targeting criteria, then buy them with a click of the button in AdWords?Just as we\u2019re working to make planning more precise, we\u2019re also focused on evolving display measurement tools.  For a long time, display advertisers have used fairly simple measures like clicks, impressions or conversions. These are great metrics for some types of marketing campaigns. But not for all.  Not every ad campaign is looking to deliver an immediate sale.  Lots of advertising \u2014 like the cologne campaign \u2014 is designed to influence opinions, spread buzz or build brand associations.  For these campaigns, measuring clicks is like trying to judge an entire movie after watching just five minutes.We\u2019re developing new measurement products designed to gauge the impact of ads on brand awareness or on user interest in the product being advertised.  Let\u2019s go back to our cologne example. Today, using our new tool called Campaign Insights, the agency can reliably measure the \u201cbrand lift\u201d directly attributable to the display campaign. This measurement tool looks at two large groups of users \u2014 one that has seen the ad, and one that hasn\u2019t.  It then compares the volume of searches and website visits to measure how awareness of the brand has improved as a result of the display ad campaign.Think about what other measurement tools may become possible.  What if the agency could use an even larger real-time focus group like, say, the entire Internet? It could include social features in the ad, and then, by parsing public reactions \u2014 tweets, blogposts, status updates, YouTube comments and more \u2014 measure, in real time, how the Internet is responding to the cologne and the ad. This could give them an immediate, quantifiable view into the reactions and views of its potential consumers, and measure the viral effect of the ad over time.  And what if the agency could precisely measure the impact of the campaign \u2014 not just on increased web traffic, searches or online comment \u2014 but (using geographical signals) on the actual purchases of their cologne in local stores?  Imagine the possibilities \u2014 display ad campaigns could even communicate with the advertiser\u2019s supply chain or inventory system.These innovations in planning and measurement are all exciting, but what\u2019s most revolutionary is what will happen when they\u2019re combined. In the future, campaign measurement will take place in near real-time, creating an almost immediate feedback loop.  Currently, the process is very linear \u2014 marketers plan their campaign, then buy ad space, then run their campaign, then measure the results, often with weeks in between.   Soon, measurement will become truly dynamic and will feed into the planning process itself.  Agencies and advertisers will be able to test multiple creatives and media plans, and immediately tweak them to deliver the best-performing ads and reach the optimal sites and audiences as measurement data starts to come in.We\u2019re on the cusp of a data renaissance in display ad planning and measurement. It promises to vastly improve online advertising for marketers, while resulting in ads that people find more relevant and effective.   And by attracting new advertisers with more valuable ads, it will help online publishers earn more money from their online content.We think that\u2019s definitely something worth shooting for.Posted by Ari Paparo, Product Management Director\n \n"

We are also sharing details about improvements to Google Docs, made possible by a new codebase that will allow us to deliver richer functionality more quickly.New document and spreadsheet featuresWe\u2019ve responded to many of your requests for features you\u2019re used to in desktop software.  In documents, we\u2019ve added a margin ruler, better numbering and bullets and easier image placement options.  And in spreadsheets, you\u2019ll now find a formula editing bar, cell auto-complete, drag-and-drop columns and other features not possible with older browser technologies.Higher fidelity document importWe\u2019ve made big improvements to our document upload feature so moving files from your computer to the cloud is easier now. Imported documents retain their original structure more accurately, so you can hit the ground running editing in the browser without having to fix formatting like bullets and text alignment.Speed and responsivenessNew browser technologies like faster JavaScript processing have made it possible for us to speed up Google Docs significantly.  Even very large spreadsheets are fast to work with in your browser now.  Applications that run this fast feel like desktop applications but have the unique advantages of being in the cloud.Faster collaborationWe\u2019ve extended Google Docs\u2019 collaboration capabilities too, with support for up to 50 people working together at once, and in documents, you can now see other people\u2019s edits as they happen character-by-character.

Check out the Webmaster Central blog for more information, including a number of free tools that you can use to increase the speed of your website.Stars in mobile searchIn early March, we announced stars in search, a feature that helps you mark and rediscover great content on the web. Recently, we extended this functionality to your mobile phone, so that you're able to view that same favorite content on the go. So, if you'd previously starred sites for [cheesecake recipe] when planning a meal at home, searching for [cheesecake recipe] on your phone in the supermarket will help you rediscover the recipe search results that looked enticing \u2014 no need to make a grocery list. Stars work both ways, so if you mark a search result while on your phone, you'll be able to see it later when you get to your desktop. This feature is currently supported on Android phones, iPhones/iPods and Palm WebOS devices in the U.S., and you need to be logged into your Google account for it to work.Updates to Google Quick ScrollIn December we launched Google Quick Scroll, an extension for Chrome which uses Google's search capabilities to help you jump directly to the portion of the page that's relevant to your search query. Since December, we've brought Quick Scroll to all the languages and domains where Chrome extensions are available. We've also continued to make constant improvements to the tool, and recently we debuted a new version with a few useful updates.Since Quick Scroll is all about getting you to information fast, it's important that it appear quickly. So we've reduced the time it takes for the tool to pop up so you don't have to wait as long. Also, if you've been using Quick Scroll for a while, you know that it doesn't appear for every result \u2014 just when Google detects that only a portion of the page is relevant to your query. Now, even if Quick Scroll doesn't appear after you click on a search result, an icon will show up in the address bar. Clicking on the icon will pop up the Quick Scroll box with an explanation of why it didn't trigger on that page.Here's what it looks like:Help for those who need itA few months ago, we introduced a search feature that displays the toll-free U.S. poison control number when you search for related information. This got us thinking about other ways we can help people get clear information from Google search in times of crisis or distress. So we recently launched a feature that displays the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at the top of the results page for certain search queries in the U.S. We hope this quick access to information helps people in emotional distress who may benefit from calling a suicide prevention hotline.Stay tuned for more updates next week.Posted by Amit Singhal, Google Fellow\n \n"

            "desc": "Today, scientists announced a new hominid fossil discovery in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site in South Africa. The discovery is one of the most significant palaeoanthropological discoveries in recent times, revealing at least two partial hominid skeletons in remarkable condition, dating to between 1.78 and 1.95 million years.  We are especially excited because Google Earth played a role in its discovery.So how did this come about?  Back in March 2008, Professor Lee Berger from Witswatersrand University in Johannesburg started to use Google Earth to map various known caves and fossil deposits identified by him and his colleagues over the past several decades, as it seemed the ideal platform by which to share information with other scientists.  In addition, he also used Google Earth to locate new fossil deposits by learning to identify what cave sites looked like in satellite images.At the beginning of this project, there were approximately 130 known cave sites in the region and around 20 fossil deposits.  With the help of the navigation facility and high-resolution satellite imagery in Google Earth, Professor Berger went on to find almost 500 previously unidentified caves and fossil sites, even though the area is one of the most explored in Africa.  One of these fossil sites yielded the remarkable discovery of a new species, Australopithecus sediba.  This species was an upright walker that shared many physical traits with the earliest known species of the genus homo \u2014 and its introduction into the fossil record might answer some key questions about our earliest ancestry in Africa.We\u2019re absolutely thrilled about this announcement, and delighted that our free mapping tools such as Google Earth and Google Maps continue to enable both individuals and distinguished scientists to explore and learn about their world. With these tools, places both foreign and familiar can be explored with the click of a mouse, allowing for new understandings of geography, topology, urbanism, development, architecture and the environment.  Our efforts to organize the world\u2019s geographic information are ongoing \u2014 but at the end of the day, seeing the way these tools are put to use is what most inspires us.Posted by Michael Jones, Chief Technology Advocate\n \n"

We worked with more than 100 partners to begin to fill in the \u201cblue\u201d part of the planet, adding hundreds of placemarks in more than 20 ocean layers. Since then, we\u2019ve added hundreds of new posts to the Ocean layer with the help of Sylvia Earle\u2019s Mission Blue Foundation and dozens of committed individuals around the world.  The posts come from a diverse range of partners including National Geographic, independent videographers and dive enthusiasts, government organizations like the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and international organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Today, the layer will become part of the default set of annotations seen by all Earth users.  Although a humble step given the dearth of information available about these vast expanses of geography, we are happy to take one more step to make the oceans a first-class part of Google Earth and to give them at least a starter portion of the thick soup of photos and places that describe the land part of the planet.  One of the greatest things about Earth is that it allows everyone to see  and experience the fullness of their planet, from revisiting places  they know well to venturing out to formerly unknown mountain peaks,  desert vistas, and increasingly, the blue heart of life on Earth. As Sylvia has said of the Ocean on many occasions, \u201cWith knowing comes caring, and with caring there\u2019s hope.\u201dSoon after last year\u2019s launch, Sylvia asked attendees at the TED conference to help her realize a wish: to create a series of marine protected areas she calls Hope Spots. Sylvia and a group of influential thinkers are now on a Mission Blue Voyage to the Galapagos Islands to brainstorm how they might best achieve better ocean protection. You can follow them on their journey by visiting the the Mission Blue Foundation website and on Twitter at @MissionBlue. There you can learn more about the launch of their Hope Spots initiative and visit all 18 of these spots using the Google Earth plugin.We\u2019ve also created a narrated tour featured in the Ocean Showcase to introduce you to eight of the regions proposed for protection: the Eastern Pacific Seascape including the Galapagos Islands, the Gulf of California, the Mesoamerican Reef in the Caribbean including Belize, the Sargasso Sea in the mid-Atlantic, the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, the Coral Triangle, the Ross Sea in the Antarctic and Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic.We\u2019d also like to take a moment to thank the partners who have helped us improve our 3D canvas of the world\u2019s oceans in the past year: NOAA (global coverage), MBARI (Monterey Bay Canyon), The California State University at Monterey Bay (California Coast), The Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping - Joint Hydrographic Center at the University of New Hampshire (Arctic) and The Living Oceans Society (British Columbia and Canada).As Earth Day approaches, we hope you\u2019ll take a little time to explore the planet, including the blue part.Posted by John Hanke, Vice President of Product Management, Google Geo\n \n"

            "desc": "This is the first in a series of posts about entrepreneurship and the resources that can help small businesses succeed. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll share the inspirational stories of real people \u2014 just like you \u2014 who\u2019ve used various Google tools to start up, maintain and grow their businesses. To kick off the series, we\u2019re starting with a post about a small business owner\u2019s experience with Google AdWords \u2014 the program that helped level the marketing field for companies of all sizes. -Ed.   Small businesses are especially close to my heart. When he retired from teaching, my father ran a small art company in Maine, and I saw firsthand how fulfilling \u2014 and how difficult \u2014 it was for him to realize his dream of running his own business. Unfortunately, his business closed its doors after just a few years. His key challenge: attracting qualified customers.Many new businesses face similar challenges, but the power of technology can help business owners find the customers they need. Whether you\u2019re a fledgling entrepreneur trying to turn your passion into a profit or an established enterprise trying to get to the next level, Internet tools like Google AdWords are the key to being there when customers come looking for you online.To show what's possible, we invited 53-year-old Jay Berkowitz to share his experience creating a business and using AdWords to help it flourish. Here's what Jay has to say:Like most first-time parents, my life completely changed when my daughter Hillary was born in 1993. My wife Janet and I decided that one of us should stay at home to care for her while the other continued working full time. Janet kept her engineering job, and I ended up quitting my job as a Wall Street bond analyst to become Mr. Mom.Later, when Hillary started school, I had more free time. It seemed like the perfect chance to do something I\u2019d always dreamed of:  launch my own business and work for myself. I started selling themed plates and lunchboxes at New York City street fairs. Then in 2001, eight-year-old Hillary showed me (her non-tech-savvy dad) how to turn on a computer. That was the beginning of taking the business online, and realizing a whole new world of possibility. Janet and I worked together to build a website, PlatesPlus4Kids.com, and we started advertising online with Google AdWords. Soon, my little project became a full-fledged venture.By advertising on the Internet, I was able to reach interested customers not only in my area, but all over the country. More and more people found my store through online searches. In no time, I had so many orders that I could no longer keep my inventory of themed cups, plates and lunchboxes on the kitchen table. The stock moved to the den, then the basement, and finally to a warehouse 20 minutes from our house in Little Neck, New York. Over the years, I've also expanded my product line and now offer children\u2019s backpacks, umbrellas, flatware, snack containers and sandwich boxes. What started as a hobby now brings in about $500,000 in sales annually.I only pay when people click on my ad and go to my website, so the cost of marketing is within my means. I increase the budget during the back-to-school season and the holidays (my peak periods) so my ads show above the search results during those times. I've also noticed that customers seem to be in a shopping mood on Mondays and Tuesdays, so I sometimes increase my budget on those days to make sure my ads show up more. Depending on trends, I create new ads to promote different characters and new inventory. For example, now that Yo Gabba Gabba is popular and baseball season is starting, I'm making adjustments so that those phrases combined with words like \u201cdishes,\u201d \u201cplacemats\u201d and \u201ccups\u201d trigger my ads. And of course, I have ads that mention items with princesses and superheroes \u2014 those are top sellers year-round.What's really great is that even though my business has expanded over the past seven years, it's still a small family company. Two people work for me at the warehouse, but I work from home. Janet takes pictures of the products and works on the website on the weekends. I've had the freedom to be a hands-on parent to Hillary and the privilege of helping other parents connect with their kids through my store. Certain celebrity parents have found me through my AdWords ads and bought items for their kids.I consider myself a pretty ordinary guy. When I started PlatesPlus for Kids, I had no idea it would become what it is today. It's heartening to know that by following your gut and putting in a lot of hard work, you can find a fulfilling second career. Or maybe a first one.Jay, Hillary and JanetPosted by Claire Johnson, Vice President, Online Sales and Operations, Advertising Programs\n \n"

            "desc": "Early last month the mayor of Topeka, Kansas stunned the world by announcing that his city was changing its name to Google.  We\u2019ve been wondering ever since how best to honor that moving gesture. Today we are pleased to announce that as of 1AM (Central Daylight Time) April 1st, Google has officially changed our name to Topeka.We didn\u2019t reach this decision lightly; after all, we had a fair amount of brand equity tied up in our old name.  But the more we surfed around (the former) Topeka\u2019s municipal website, the more kinship we felt with this fine city at the edge of the Great Plains.In fact, Topeka Google Mayor Bill Bunten expressed it best: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled. Even Google recognizes that all roads lead to Kansas, not just yellow brick ones.\u201dFor 150 years, its fortuitous location at the confluence of the Kansas River and the Oregon Trail has made the city formerly known as Topeka a key jumping-off point to the new world of the West, just as for 150 months the company formerly known as Google has been a key jumping-off point to the new world of the web. When in 1858 a crucial bridge built across the Kansas River was destroyed by flooding mere months later, it was promptly rebuilt \u2014 and we too are accustomed to releasing 2.0 versions of software after stormy feedback on our \u2018beta\u2019 releases. And just as the town's nickname is \"Top City,\" and the word \u201ctopeka\u201d itself derives from a term used by the Kansa and Ioway tribes to refer to \u201ca good place to dig for potatoes,\u201d we\u2019d like to think that our website is one of the web's top places to dig for information.In the early 20th century, the former Topeka enjoyed a remarkable run of political prominence, gracing the nation with Margaret Hill McCarter, the first woman to address a national political convention (1920, Republican); Charles Curtis, the only Native American ever to serve as  vice president (\u201929 to \u201833, under Herbert Hoover); Carrie Nation, leader of the old temperance movement (and wielder of American history\u2019s most famous hatchet); and, most important, Alfred E. Neuman, arguably the most influential figure to an entire generation of Americans. We couldn\u2019t be happier to add our own chapter to this storied history.A change this dramatic won\u2019t happen without consequences, perhaps even some disruptions.  Here are a few of the thorny issues that we hope everyone in the broader Topeka community will bear in mind as we begin one of the most important transitions in our company\u2019s history:Correspondence to both our corporate headquarters and offices around the world should now be addressed to Topeka Inc., but otherwise can be addressed normally.Google employees once known as \u201cGooglers\u201d should now be referred to as either \u201cTopekers\u201d or \u201cTopekans,\u201d depending on the result of a board meeting that\u2019s ongoing at this hour.  Whatever the outcome, the conclusion is clear: we aren\u2019t in Google anymore.Our new product names will take some getting used to. For instance, we\u2019ll have to assure users of Topeka News and Topeka Maps that these services will continue to offer news and local information from across the globe. Topeka Talk, similarly, is an instant messaging product, not, say, a folksy midwestern morning show. And Project Virgle, our co-venture with Richard Branson and Virgin to launch the first permanent human colony on Mars, will henceforth be known as Project Vireka. We don\u2019t really know what to tell Oliver Google Kai\u2019s parents, except that, if you ask us, Oliver Topeka Kai would be a charming name for their little boy.As our lawyers remind us, branded product names can achieve such popularity as to risk losing their trademark status (see cellophane, zippers, trampolines, et al).  So we hope all of you will do your best to remember our new name\u2019s proper usage: Finally, we want to be clear that this initiative is a one-shot deal that will have no bearing on which municipalities are chosen to participate in our experimental ultra-high-speed broadband project, to which Google, Kansas has been just one of many communities to apply.Posted by Eric Schmidt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Topeka Inc.\n \n"

A gallon of gas cost 89 cents, Paul Simon\u2019s Graceland won the Grammy for album of the year, and the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which governs how law enforcement can access electronic data, was signed into law.A lot has changed since 1986.  Gas is now measured in dollars and Taylor Swift (born 1989) won album of the year.  All the while, technology has moved at record pace.  But ECPA has stayed the same.  Originally designed to protect us from unwarranted government intrusion while ensuring that law enforcement had the tools necessary to protect public safety, it was written long before most people had heard of email, cell phones or the \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 the term used for programs helping people store personal data like photos and documents online.  As a result, ECPA has become outdated.This is why we\u2019re proud to help establish Digital Due Process, a coalition of technology companies, civil rights organizations and academics seeking to update ECPA to provide privacy protections to new and emerging technologies.Specifically, we want to modernize ECPA in four ways:Better protect your data stored online: The government must first get a search warrant before obtaining any private communications or documents stored online;Better protect your location privacy: The government must first get a search warrant before it can track the location of your cell phone or other mobile communications device;Better protect against monitoring of when and with whom you communicate: The government must demonstrate to a court that the data it seeks is relevant and material to a criminal investigation before monitoring when and with whom you communicate using email, instant messaging, text messaging, the telephone, etc.; andBetter protect against bulk data requests: The government must demonstrate to a court that the information it seeks is needed for a criminal investigation before it can obtain data about an entire class of users.We also created this video to help explain ECPA and why it needs updating:You can read more about our proposal at our coalition website. In the coming months, we\u2019ll meet with lawmakers, law enforcement officials and others to help build support for modernizing the law.1986 was a good year, but it\u2019s time our laws catch up with how we live our lives today.Posted by Richard Salgado, Senior Counsel, Law Enforcement and Information Security\n \n"
